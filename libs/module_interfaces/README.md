# Module interfaces
named module interfaces for libraries
we include. The process of creating named modules
to import is not that complex. The usability of
modules is getting there but the details of how
code is distributed and delivered is something
unclear to me as of now. This folder and these
interfaces will serve as stepping stones
in allowing us the benefits of modules
filing bug reports on our finds and hopefully
contributing to the adoption and usability of
c++ modules.
